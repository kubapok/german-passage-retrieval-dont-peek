German Passage Retrieval (MIRACL)
=====================================

German dev dataset from the [MIRACL challenge](https://project-miracl.github.io).

The dataset consists of 305 queries in the German language. 

The `expected.tsv` file should contain tab-separated identifiers of passages relevant to the queries (max 10 per query). The identifiers correspond to passages that are located in the German split of the dataset found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/miracl/miracl-corpus).
